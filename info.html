    <h2>1. Understanding Carbon Emissions</h2>
    <p>
      Greenhouse gases such as <strong>CO₂, CH₄ (methane)</strong> and
      <strong>N₂O (nitrous oxide)</strong> are the main drivers of global
      warming. Mining operations emit these gases through equipment usage,
      fuel combustion, and ventilation losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each gas has a different <strong>Global Warming Potential (GWP)</strong> —
      methane is 28–36 times more potent than CO₂, and N₂O is nearly 300 times
      more powerful.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="info-section alt-bg" id="data">
    <h2>2. Global & Indian Mining Emissions</h2>
    <p>
      Globally, coal mining contributes nearly <strong>1 gigatonne of CO₂e</strong> annually.
      India ranks among the top five emitters, with the coal sector responsible for
      about <strong>10% of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      India’s major coal-producing regions—Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh—
      face both emission intensity and policy scrutiny. The government has initiated
      programs under the <strong>National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)</strong> and
      <strong>Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT)</strong> schemes to reduce industrial footprints.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="info-section" id="importance">
    <h2>3. Why Emission Calculation Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Without quantification, mitigation is impossible. Accurate emission
      estimation enables industries to identify high-impact activities, track
      progress toward reduction targets, and qualify for <strong>carbon credits</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also supports transparency, better policy enforcement, and informed
      decision-making for sustainable resource management.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="info-section alt-bg" id="neutrality">
    <h2>4. Carbon Neutrality & Carbon Credits</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Carbon neutrality</strong> means achieving a balance between
      emissions produced and emissions removed. This is often achieved through
      a combination of emission reduction and compensatory measures such as
      afforestation, renewable energy transition, or methane capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tonne of CO₂ avoided or absorbed can earn a <strong>carbon credit</strong>,
      tradable in global markets — offering both environmental and financial
      incentives for industries.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="info-section" id="india">
    <h2>5. India’s Path Toward Sustainable Mining</h2>
    <p>
      India aims to reduce its <strong>emission intensity by 45% by 2030</strong>
      under the Paris Agreement commitments. Sustainable coal mining now includes
      methane recovery, dust suppression, energy efficiency, and post-mining
      land reclamation programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public sector undertakings like Coal India Limited are testing
      <strong>underground coal gasification</strong> and <strong>solar-powered
      operations</strong> as part of their sustainability initiatives.

    <h2>6. Our Role – ZeroSphere’s Contribution</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>ZeroSphere</strong> serves as a transparent, data-driven platform
      for quantifying mine emissions, identifying carbon sinks, and exploring
      neutralization pathways. It bridges scientific computation with
      environmental responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to enable industries to transition from estimation to
      <strong>empowerment</strong> — making carbon neutrality measurable,
      achievable, and meaningful.
